# BoCheat-Unturned
Unturned Fully-Featured Cheat Base
## Information

### Given the age of Unturned, and the player base shifting, this project will no longer be developed. Last merge is accurately the last time the cheat was fully functional, with features gradually losing functionality over the next months.

This project heavily relies on [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony/).


## Injection
This DLL needs to be compiled, then loaded to the game, and you need to call the [Main.Yo](https://github.com/lgv-0/BoCheat-Unturned/blob/master/HInj/HInj/Main.cs#L116-L126) function at least once. There's a bad check to detect if it's called multiple times, in which it will ignore further calls.

## Usage
Once loaded, the menu will be visible on the escape/pause menu's. Group Members are default ignored by the cheat, optionally ignore steam friends too.

Chat commands are also available [here](https://github.com/lgv-0/BoCheat-Unturned/blob/master/HInj/HInj/Hooks/sendChat/Hold.cs#L28).
